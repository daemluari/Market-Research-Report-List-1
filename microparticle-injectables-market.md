<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microparticle Injectables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Degradable</li><li>Non-Degradable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The microparticle injectables market is divided into two primary types: degradable and non-degradable. Degradable microparticles are designed to break down within the body over time, releasing their therapeutic agents in a controlled manner. This facilitates longer-lasting effects and reduces the need for frequent injections. In contrast, non-degradable microparticles remain intact in the body and require either surgical removal or sustained therapeutic applications. Both types are utilized in various medical fields, including drug delivery and vaccine development.</p></p>
