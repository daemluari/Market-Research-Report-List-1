<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Air Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane air dryers are essential for removing moisture from compressed air systems. The market is divided into two main types: porous and non-porous membrane dryers. Porous membranes allow air to pass through while filtering out water vapor, making them effective for applications requiring high moisture removal. Non-porous membranes, on the other hand, separate moisture through diffusion, providing a more selective barrier. Each type caters to different industrial needs, balancing efficiency, cost, and desired air quality.</p></p>
