<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Hydraulic System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Center</li><li>Closed-Center</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft hydraulic system market is categorized into two main types: open-center and closed-center systems. Open-center systems allow fluid to flow freely and return to the reservoir when not in use, making them simpler and lighter, ideal for smaller aircraft. Closed-center systems maintain constant pressure in the system, allowing for more efficient operation, especially in larger, more complex aircraft where simultaneous control of multiple actuators is necessary. Each type serves distinct operational needs within the aviation industry.</p></p>
