<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Crash Attenuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Redirective Crash Attenuator</li><li>Non-redirective Crash Attenuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The road crash attenuator market is divided into two primary types: redirective and non-redirective crash attenuators. Redirective crash attenuators are designed to absorb impact energy while redirecting vehicles back onto the roadway, minimizing the risk of secondary collisions. In contrast, non-redirective crash attenuators focus solely on energy absorption without redirecting vehicles, effectively reducing the severity of impact for errant vehicles. Both types enhance road safety, but their operational mechanisms and applications vary based on roadway requirements and conditions.</p></p>
