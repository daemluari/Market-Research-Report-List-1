<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital X-ray Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CR</li><li>DR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital X-ray machine market is primarily categorized into two types: Computed Radiography (CR) and Digital Radiography (DR). CR utilizes imaging plates to capture X-ray images, which are then scanned and converted into digital formats, offering flexibility and lower initial costs. In contrast, DR employs direct or indirect detectors that immediately convert X-rays into digital images, providing faster processing times and improved image quality. Both technologies enhance diagnostic capabilities but differ in equipment complexity and operational efficiencies.</p></p>
